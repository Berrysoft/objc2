# Contributing to `objc2`

Thank you for your interest in contributing! There are many ways to contribute and we appreciate all of them.


## `git` submodules

The `icrate` crate contains a submodule pointing to
[`madsmtm/icrate-generated`]. This exists to keep the primary repository free
from the clutter inherently associated with storing generated files in `git`,
while still allowing change-tracking of said files.

You should consider whether you want a shallow or a full checkout of the
generated files - the default is to do a shallow clone, since the repository
can become quite large over time.

```sh
# Shallow clone
git submodule update --init
```

```sh
# Full clone
git submodule update --init --no-recommend-shallow
```

See the excellent `git` [documentation on submodules][submodule-docs], or the
manpage for [`git-submodule`] for further details on how submodules work.

### Updating the `git` submodule

When making changes to `header-translator`, you must update the `git`
submodule manually and push your changes to a fork of `icrate-generated` (you
do not need to submit a PR to that repo).

We try to maintain a linear history in that repo, in a fashion such that every
ref that is ever referenced from the `HEAD` branch in this repository, is
reachable from the `HEAD` branch that repository. This will probably mean
you'll have to rebase more often.

If you're confused about this, don't worry too much about it, if you enable
"Allow edits by maintainers" we can fix it for you.
