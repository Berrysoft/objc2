  = note: calls in statics are limited to constant functions, tuple structs and tuple variants
  = note: consider wrapping this expression in `Lazy::new(|| ...)` from the `once_cell` crate: https://crates.io/crates/once_cell
  = note: this error originates in the macro `$crate::__ns_string_inner` which comes from the expansion of the macro `ns_string` (in Nightly builds, run with -Z macro-backtrace for more info)
