Rust bindings to Apple's frameworks.

This README is kept intentionally small in an effort to consolidate the documentation, see [the Rust docs](https://docs.rs/icrate/) for more details.


## Supported versions

These bindings are automatically generated from the SDKs in Xcode 14.3.1 (will
be periodically updated).

Currently supports:
- macOS: `10.12-13.1`
- iOS/iPadOS: `10.0-16.2` (WIP)
- tvOS: `10.0-16.1` (WIP)
